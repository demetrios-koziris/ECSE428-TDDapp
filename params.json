To generate the APK, we used the Build APK function in Android Studio (Build -> Build APK). A debug APK (sufficient) for our purposes is generated in ECSE428-TDDapp/PostalRateCalculator/app/build/outputs/apk folder. \r\n\r\n2. For convenience, we've put an apk in the top-level folder. It can also be downloaded directly from the following link\r\n<p align=\"center\">\r\n<a href=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/demetrios-koziris/ECSE428-TDDapp/master/app-debug.apk\">Download Mobile Postal Rate Calculator</a>\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n3. To run, download the .apk file on your android device, open it, and click Install. Note that you must have \"Unknown sources: Allow installation of applications from both trusted and unknown sources\" turned on in your settings or you will be prompted to change this setting before you can install.\r\n\r\n4.
